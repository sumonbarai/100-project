          Sure! You can test out Webflow on our free plan where you can
          experiment with 2 projects. Your unhosted projects will have a
          two-page limit, but you can purchase a site plan on a per-project
          basis to unlock up to 100 static pages and additional CMS pages.

          A project is a website that you build in Webflow. You can publish
          projects to a webflow.io staging subdomain for free, export the code
          on a paid plan, or add a site plan to connect your custom domain and
          unlock hosting features.

          source code and form submission emails, and hide the Webflow badge
          from their staging sites.
