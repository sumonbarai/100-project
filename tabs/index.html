            Caden Tellier was taken to a hospital in critical condition after a
            head injury in John T. Morgan Academy’s game against visiting
            Southern Academy, officials said Friday night, and his death was
            announced the next day.

            “Our boy, Caden Tellier has met Jesus face to face,” Tellier’s
            parents said Saturday in a statement. “Everyone who knows Caden has
            known kindness, generosity and love, and true to his nature, he is
            giving of himself one more time. “﻿Lives have been touched by the
            way he lived and now lives will be saved through his passing.”
